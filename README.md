# DBMS project 3-1
 
Excited to share that I recently completed my Semester 3-1 database project with my teammate, Md. Abdur Rahman Eshan . This project marked my first experience with PHP and AJAX, using database in practical level and completing queries was rewarding on a personal level, and while over 50% of the code came from online resources, it was an incredible learning journey. Despite being new to web development stacks, the process felt like tasting honey for the first timeâ€”sweet and rewarding!
